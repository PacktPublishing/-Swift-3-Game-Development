## About the Book

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import SpriteKit 
 
class GameScene: SKScene { 
 override func didMove(to view: SKView) { 
 } 
}  
```

This book uses the Xcode IDE, version 8.2.1 (Swift 3). If you use a different version of Xcode you will likely encounter syntax differences; Apple is constantly upgrading Swift’s syntax. You can use Xcode’s Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax to update the code examples in this book to newer version of Xcode.

Visit https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ to download Xcode.

You will need an Apple developer account to integrate your apps with the Game Center and to submit your games to the App Store.

Note: Chapter 1 has no code as it is an introductory chapter and Chapter 11 has no code files present.
